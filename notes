What is Serializer in DRF ?

    In Django Rest Framework (DRF), a serializer is a crucial component 
    that transforms complex data types, such as Django models or querysets, 
    into Python data types that can be easily converted to JSON and sent 
    to the client. Conversely, it also converts incoming JSON data into
    Python data types suitable for processing in a Django view.

    Various Works Done By Serializer: 
    1) Data Validation: Serializers perform validation on incoming data, ensuring that it meets the expected format and constraints. 

    2) Data Transformation: Serializers convert complex data types, such as Django models, into JSON-compatible representations. 

    3) Handling Relationships: DRF serializers handle relationships between models, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

    4) Integration with Django Forms: DRF serializers are similar to Django forms, providing a way to define the structure of the data you want to work with. This allows for a smooth transition for developers familiar with Django.

Working With Serializer and Views for API creation

    1.1) serializers.Serializer
        -> Working with Function Based Views 
    
    1.2) serializers.Serializer
        -> Working with Class Based Views  
            APIVIEW -> Simple Class Based Views
                    -> Generic Views 
                    -> Mixins 
                    -> Concrete  View Classes
                    -> ViewSets   

    2.1) serializers.ModelSerializer
        -> Working with Function Based Views 
    
    2.2) serializers.ModelSerializer
        -> Working with Class Based Views  
            APIVIEW ->Simple Class Based Views
                    -> Generic Views 
                    -> Mixins 
                    -> Concrete  View Classes
                    ->ViewSets

Serializer Improvement Through Validators:
    Three Types of Validators:
        1.field level - Individual field (like name) is validated at once.
        2.object level - As a whole comparision of objects are done and validation is performed.
        3.validators - Individual field (like name) is validated with validator keyword and function.
